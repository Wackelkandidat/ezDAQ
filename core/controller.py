Measurement controller: central interface between the GUI and the
underlying layers (hardware, ring buffer, DAQ thread).

Architecture (see spec):

    GUI -> Measurement Controller -> Hardware Interface -> nidaqmx -> NI cDAQ

The GUI exclusively calls methods of this controller - it knows neither
`RingBuffer` nor `BaseDevice` nor `nidaqmx` directly.
