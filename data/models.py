data/models.py

Central data models of the application.

This module contains pure data structures (no hardware or GUI logic).
All other layers (hardware, core, gui, analysis) use these models as a
shared "language" to describe channels, devices, and measurements.

Design decision:
    The models are deliberately implemented as `dataclasses` with type
    hints. That keeps them lightweight, JSON-serializable (see
    data/metadata.py), and easy to extend without GUI or hardware code
    having to know about them.

    A hammer strike above `impact_condition` is captured as a fixed-size
    block (`analysis/modal_analysis.py::ModalAverager`,
    `core/impact_detector.py::ImpactDetector`) and averaged into a
    running H1/H2 frequency response function plus coherence.

    Attributes:
        excitation_channel_hardware_id: Hardware channel of the impact
            hammer (`Channel.hardware_channel`).
        response_channel_hardware_id: Hardware channel of the response
            accelerometer.
        excitation_window: Time window applied to the excitation block
            before the FFT - "force" (short plateau, then a fast drop to
            suppress post-pulse noise) or "rectangular".
        response_window: Time window applied to the response block -
            "exponential" (damps a not-yet-decayed ringdown before the
            FFT wraps), "hann", or "rectangular".
        frequency_resolution_hz: Desired frequency spacing Δf. The block
            size in samples is derived from this and the sample rate
            (block_size = round(fs / Δf)) rather than being configured
            directly - Δf is the quantity that actually matters for
            resolving close resonances.
        num_averages_target: How many accepted impacts make up one
            complete average (shown as "N / target" in the live view).
        estimator: Frequency response estimator - "h1" (Gxf/Gff, good
            for a noisy response and a clean force signal - the normal
            case for hammer testing) or "h2" (Gxx/Gfx, good for a noisy
            excitation).
        frf_quantity: Which quantity is DISPLAYED by default -
            "accelerance" (response/force, measured directly, no
            division by omega, no singularity at 0 Hz), "mobility"
            (velocity/force) or "receptance" (displacement/force). All
            three are derived from the same complex measurement, see
            `analysis/modal_analysis.py::ModalAverager.frf`.
        impact_condition: Reuses `TriggerCondition` - the same
            channel/threshold/direction description already used for
            `TriggerConfig.start`/`.stop` - to describe "the excitation
            channel exceeds X". Only the THRESHOLD-relevant fields
            (`threshold_channel_hardware_id`, `threshold_value`,
            `threshold_direction`) are used; `kind` is not evaluated
            here.
        pretrigger_ms: How many milliseconds BEFORE the detected impact
            instant are included in the captured block (like the
            existing recording pre-roll, but per impact rather than per
            measurement) - see `core/ringbuffer.py::RingBuffer.
            register_reader`.

            excitation block within which a second peak counts as a
            double hit rather than noise.
        double_hit_relative_threshold: A second peak within
            `double_hit_window_ms` counts as a double hit only if it
            reaches at least this fraction of the main peak - filters
            out ordinary hammer-tip ringing.
        min_rest_time_ms: Minimum quiet time after a captured block
            before the detector arms again - prevents the response
            ringdown of the same strike from being mistaken for a new
            one.
        overload_fraction: A captured block is rejected as overloaded if
            either channel's absolute value reaches this fraction of its

            of the same physical module - the channel table therefore
            automatically propagates a change to all channels of the same
            module, see `gui/widgets/channel_table.py`.
        plot_color: Individual curve color in the live view (e.g.
            "#64b5f6"), `None` = theme default color (see
            `gui/live_view.py::ChannelDisplayDialog`).
        plot_background: Individual plot background color, `None` =
            theme default background.
        plot_grid_color: Individual gridline color, `None` = theme
            default (foreground color, see
            `gui/live_view.py::_channel_grid_color`).
        plot_y_min: Lower Y-axis display range of the live view. Unlike
            `min_range`/`max_range` (hardware measurement range), a
            purely display-related setting - `None` falls back to
            `min_range` or -10.0.
        plot_y_max: Upper Y-axis display range of the live view, `None`
            falls back to `max_range` or 10.0.
        plot_autoscale: Whether the Y axis automatically switches to the
            actual value range when `plot_y_min`/`plot_y_max` is
            exceeded/undershot - if `False`, the fixed range always
            stays active.
        plot_show_x_label: Whether the X axis TITLE ("Time [s]") is
            drawn on the plot. Only the title text - tick marks, tick
            numbers and the grid stay untouched. Off gives the space
            back to the plot area, which is what makes it worth having
            with many subplots in one grid.
        plot_show_y_label: Same for the Y axis title (channel name plus
            unit, see `gui/live_view.py::_channel_axis_label`).
        plot_visible: Whether the channel is shown as its own subplot in
            the live view. Affects ONLY the display, not
            acquisition/storage - a channel with `plot_visible=False` is
            still recorded normally, it just doesn't appear in the live
            view grid (see `gui/live_view.py::_rebuild_plots`).
